"""Perspective helpers shared by the sim env (team 0 = you) and the self-play opponent (team 1).

The engine is asymmetric on screen -- team 0 defends the BOTTOM, team 1 the TOP -- but the policy was
only ever trained from team 0's point of view (you at the bottom/blue, enemy at the top/red, deploy in
the lower half, attack up). To let a FROZEN copy of that same policy pilot team 1 (self-play), we show
it a MIRRORED board: a 180-degree rotation `(x, y) -> (1 - x, 1 - y)` puts team 1 at the bottom so the
policy sees itself exactly as it was trained. The chosen placement cell is transformed back the same way
before it hits the engine. `to_local(..., team=0)` is the identity, so team 0's render/threat are byte
-for-byte what the env produced before -- these helpers just generalise the existing code to either team.
