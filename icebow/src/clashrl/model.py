"""CNN policy network for the learning bot.

Takes a downscaled arena image, the identities of the cards currently in hand (a
multi-hot over the deck), the next (preview) card (a one-hot), the normalized
elixir, **and an enemy-threat feature vector** (colour/size/count/lane/depth/speed
+ projectile, from clashrl.threats), and outputs two heads:
  - card:    which of the DECK cards to play (identity, not tray position)
  - anchor:  which of that card's NAMED PLACEMENT ANCHORS to use (clashrl.actions)

Acting on card identity -- not tray position -- is the point: the same card cycles
through different tray positions, so a slot-indexed policy would learn an
inconsistent target. The placement head is likewise indexed by the card's own
ANCHOR LIST, not by a board grid: the 18x24 grid could not express the exact
tiles this deck is decided by (an X-Bow's 4-tile vs 5-tile placement), so it was
replaced by per-card named anchors. The head is `n_anchors` wide -- the widest
card's anchor count -- and is MASKED per card, exactly as the card head is masked
to the hand. The hand multi-hot is fed in because the arena image is
downscaled too far to read the tray; the next card is fed in so the policy can
plan cycles (hold a cheap card to line up the counter that's coming); the threat
vector is fed in so the policy can learn REACTIVE counters (the small image loses
the cues -- goblin green, swarm vs tank, lane, an incoming barrel -- that pick the
right defence). At inference the card logits are masked to the cards actually in
hand, and the chosen identity is mapped to its live slot.

Shared conv trunk + adaptive pool keeps it robust to the exact observation size.
